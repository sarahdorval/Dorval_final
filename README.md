# 221-final-template
Contains HTML and CSS files for JNL 221's final project.  
  
## Follow the below directions to complete your final project template. Remember to have final.html open in a browser to see your changes taking place:  
1. In the head of final.html, under the appropriate comment, add a link tag to connect your HTML file to your CSS file.  
2. In the head of final.html, under the appropriate comment, add the Google font 'Poppins' to your project.  
3. In final.css, add styles for a p element: a font family of Poppins (with a default of sans-serif), and a font size of 20px.  
4. In final.html, give the first section element a class of 'header'.  
5. In that section element, fill in the byline with the h4 element with your name.  
6. In the second section element in final.html, add an img tag below the h3. Add the image within this folder as the src attribute, as well as an appropriate alt text. Add a height of 150px and a width of 200px.  
7. In the fourth section, under the appropriate comment, add one of your final project Datawrapper charts using an iframe.  
8. In final.css, change the background color of .header to be something other than black and choose a compatible color for the text. Use this color palette generator: https://coolors.co/. (Click on 'Start the generator!' and use the space bar to scroll through different color palettes.)  
9. In final.css, add styles for an img element: a float of right, a margin-right of 5% and a margin-left of 5%. Go to your browser to see this change, and drag your browser to different sizes to see what this does.  
10. In final.html, add an appropriate hed and dek for your final project story. Make sure it reflects what is newsworthy about your story, similar to a dataviz finding.  
11. Change or add one thing to your CSS that you'd like your project to have. It cannot be just a color or border; it must be something we have not done together in class.
